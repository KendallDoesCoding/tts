# Text To Speech

Run the following commands in terminal
- ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` - Download modules required for tts to work
- ``python3 tts.py`` - Run python in terminal

A messege will then appear in the terminal asking you, "Enter what you want to say", enter what you want to say and text to speech will say it for you.
